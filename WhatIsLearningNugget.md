# What is Learning Nugget?

Learning Nugget is a methodology of learning (and potential platform) for learning computer science knowledge that makes use of a parallel programming concept called MapReduce. It can be extended to be its own platform in the future.

## How does it work?

1) Keep a backlog of things to learn (called "learning nuggets")
2) Distribute the learning goals to people on the team
3) Each team member

    - learns their material
    - optional: creates personal notes based on their learning
    - optional: creates concise notes of their learning and shares it with the team or simply says: `"This is a great explanation of X: <link>"`

4) Each team member

    - Reads the notes/articles they are interested in
    - Asks the "experts" questions related to what they learned

## Why start this?

1) **Learning Exposure**: Suppose there are 10 people on the team. That means each person can be theoretically exposed to 10x the material to learn from. This leads to more things learned for each team member.
2) **Social Interaction**: This can be a great way to meet and interact with like-minded people towards a productive goal.
3) **More Efficient Learning**: Instead of each person individually struggling with material they learn, one person can go through the inefficient way of learning to become an "expert" in the topic, and questions from the other group members can be directed to the expert.

## How is this implemented?

### Implementation 1: Discord with Github Wikis

- Discord would be used for co-ordination and updates.
- Each team member would have their own LearningNugget repo for their notes and "learning nuggets".
- A central repo would have a list of all of the learning nuggets from each team member (this can easily be automated).

This method is chosen as of May 2, 2025.

## Guidelines

### Personal Repo Guidelines

When creating your own LearningNugget repo, please do the following for consistency.

1) Put original articles in the wiki section of your Learning Nugget repo.
2) Whenever a new "learning nugget" (something new you learned about) is ready to be contributed, add a short summary to the Nuggets.md file, as well as an entry in the NuggetsTable.md file.
3) See https://github.com/herougo/LearningNugget (and its wiki) for an example repo.
