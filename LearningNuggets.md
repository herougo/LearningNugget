### 3: Build Your Own React - May 7, 2025

This article goes over how to build a simplified version of React (using actual code) using the same function names the actual React code uses. 

I found the constant changes to the code sometimes non-trivial to follow, so to fully understand the final product, I created [this repo](https://github.com/herougo/didact/server) as a fork. This repo splits the final code file into separate files (with extra comments) which can be read in order to truly understand the code.
